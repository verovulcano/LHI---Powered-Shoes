# LHI - Powered-Shoes

In virtual environment applications, users need a good sense of movement. In the past years, there have been several prototypes of interface devices (e.g., treadmills and carpets) in order to create infinite surfaces for walking. However, these systems require cumbersome drive mechanisms. Therefore, the aim of the Powered Shoes project is to provide motor-driven roller skates in order to develop a wearable locomotion interface that enables users to walk in all directions while maintaining their position.\
\
In our work, we implemented a system of users wearing the Powered Shoes moving in a room of limited size. Each user needs to avoid both the other users and the walls of the room; in order to achieve this, we have used a velocity-level decentralized control based on Artificial Potential Fields.

The project is developed by:
  - Rossella Bonuomo
  - Marco Pennese
  - Veronica Vulcano
